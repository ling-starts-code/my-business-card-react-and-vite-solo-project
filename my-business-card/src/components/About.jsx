      <h2> About</h2>
      <p> Kia ora! I am a people-oriented agile full-stack web developer who values high communications, and brings a fresh perspective and a sense of humour to the team. I love to sink my teeth into problems to make continuous improvements, from coding to life. I believe in life-long learning and enjoy pushing myself out of my comfort zone. I grasp new concepts quickly and consider myself a doer on the go!</p>
